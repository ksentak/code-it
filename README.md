Code It is a custom code and markdown editor that allows a user to run
JavaScript in the browser. Users can import npm packages to be used in their
code. Users can also create their own React components. Use the show function
`show()` to output your code into the preview component. Code cells are
cumulative and variables that are set in upper cells can be used in cells lower
on the page.
